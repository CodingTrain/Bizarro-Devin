# "Bizarro" Devin Brainstorming Features

## Core behaviors

- auto write code into `sketch.js` (incrementally)
- look at errors and fix bugs
- narrate its process of writing the code
- preview pane to show p5.js canvas (w/ auto-refresh)

## Interaction Features

- Use whisper to listen to what I am saying
- Narrate the process, banter with me using TTS model?

## ML Model

- Fine-tune a model?
- RAG with nature of code book or other CT challenge examples?
- multi-modal so it can look at the canvas

### Models/frameworks under consideration

My preference is for on device and fine-tuned model.

- Gemma
- transformers.js models
- llama (via ollama)
- localAI models
